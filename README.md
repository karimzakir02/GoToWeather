# GoToWeather
GoToWeather is a personal project written in GoLang. The purpose of the website is to connect to multiple weather sources and calculates average measurements based on those sources.

I've made this project in order to get more experience with GoLang, as well as practice implementing concurrent processes.

### This project demonstrates that I know how to:
- Handle GET requests in GoLang
- Implement concurrent processes with GoLang
- Web scrape using GoLang
- Use structs and point/value receivers
- Read/Parse CSV files with GoLang
- Connect the frontend and the backend in a GoLang project
- Use simple Bootstrap in the HTML

### Future Plans for the Project:
- Add support to get weather data for any city
- Increase the amount of measurements provided
